## Flute

In my free time, I am an amateur flutist. I have studied flute for 14 years and was a music double major at Pomona College. My primary teachers have been [Catherine Ransom Karoly](https://www.laphil.com/musicdb/artists/2756/catherine-ransom-karoly) (Los Angeles Philharmonic) and [Rachel Rudich](https://rachelrudich.com/) (Pomona College). I also spent two summers in Israel studying with [Guy Eshed](https://aicf.org/artist/guy-eshed/) and [Yossi Arnheim](https://aicf.org/artist/yossi-arnheim/) of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as four summers studying at the [Orford Music Academy](https://www.orford.mu/en/academy/) in Quebec. You can check out my playing on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ilanashapiroflute)!

## Research on Mieczysław Weinberg

At Pomona, I did extensive research on the Jewish Polish Soviet Holocaust-era composer Mieczysław Weinberg. For my music major, I wrote an [extensive thesis](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/pomona_theses/265/) examining qualities of identity, narrative, and memory in Weinberg's music, and I also presented a [recital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4-mKDdsOVw&list=PLPwyBV1x-R8ZPdgk8EtO-Gh8l6Li0SH0j) of my transcriptions of his nearly-lost cello works. Two of my transcriptions are currently in the final stage of publication with the international publishing company [Peermusic Classical Europe](https://www.peermusicclassical.de/). I continue be passionate about resurrecting Weinberg's music.
