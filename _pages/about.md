Welcome! I am a 3rd-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego in the [Programming Systems](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) group in La Jolla, CA, advised by [Sorin Lerner](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/). I also work closely with [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) and [Shlomo Dubnov](http://shlomodubnov.wikidot.com/about) and am involved in the [Music Understanding Synthesis and AI Creativity](https://ucsd-musaic.github.io/) group. In summer 2025, I interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) in the [Research in Software Engineering (RiSE)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/) group, researching online SMT parallization algorithms and natural language reasoning for program verification under the mentorship of [Nikolaj Bjorner](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nbjorner/). Before coming to UCSD, I double majored in Computer Science and Music and minored in Mathematics at Pomona College in Claremont, CA, where I was advised by [Yuqing Melanie Wu](https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/yuqing-melanie-wu) and [Ben Wiedermann](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/) in CS, and [Alfred Cramer](https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/alfred-cramer) in Music. I used to work as a software engineer at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), and as a freelance software engineer at [Stainless](https://www.stainlessapi.com).

My research interests lie in the intersection of Programming Languages (PL), AI, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I aim to develop human-interpretable structural constraints on sequence models for the controllable generation of well-formed sequence data. My ultimate goal is to create a richly interactive, human-machine co-creation process enabling end-users to produce structurally sound outputs.

My recent work combined stochastic and formal logic techniques to frame and solve the nested NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem of music structure summarization as an extension of the Generalized Median Graph problem. I am now exploring constrained decoding of sequence models to apply these results as controllable, hierarchical structural constraints on the model. I am also continuing my research in SMT parallelization. Check out [Projects](projects/) and [Publications](publications/) for more details!

Besides research, I am passionate about mentoring, and served as Mentorship Co-Chair for UCSD's [Graduate Women in Computing](https://gradwic.ucsd.edu/) organization in the 2024-2025 school year. In my free time, I am an amateur [flutist](https://www.youtube.com/@ilanashapiroflute), and I enjoy continuing my undergraduate musicology research on the Jewish Polish Soviet Holocaust-era composer Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg.
