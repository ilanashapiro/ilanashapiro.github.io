Welcome! I am a 3rd-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego in the [Programming Systems](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) group in La Jolla, CA, advised by [Sorin Lerner](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/). In summer 2025, I interned at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) in the [Research in Software Engineering (RiSE)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/) group, researching online SMT parallization algorithms and natural language reasoning for program verification under the mentorship of [Nikolaj Bjorner](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nbjorner/). In summer 2026, I am excited to be joining the [Automated Reasoning Team](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/automated-reasoning) at [Amazon Research](https://www.amazon.science/). Before coming to UCSD, I double majored in Computer Science and Music and minored in Mathematics at Pomona College in Claremont, CA, where I was advised by [Yuqing Melanie Wu](https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/yuqing-melanie-wu) and [Ben Wiedermann](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/) in CS, and [Alfred Cramer](https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/alfred-cramer) in Music. I used to work as a software engineer at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), and as a freelance software engineer at [Stainless](https://www.stainlessapi.com).

My research interests lie in the intersection of Programming Languages (PL), Automated Reasoning, and AI. I am currently working on parallelization algorithms for SMT solvers, and am also intereseted in constrained decoding of LLMs with human-interpretable structural constraints. My ultimate goal is to create a richly interactive, human-machine co-creation process enabling end-users to produce structurally sound outputs.

My previous work combined stochastic and formal logic techniques to frame and solve the nested NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem of music structure summarization as an extension of the Generalized Median Graph problem. Check out [Projects](projects/) and [Publications](publications/) for more details!

Besides research, I am passionate about mentoring, and served as Mentorship Co-Chair for UCSD's [Graduate Women in Computing](https://gradwic.ucsd.edu/) organization in the 2024-2025 school year. In my free time, I am an amateur [flutist](https://www.youtube.com/@ilanashapiroflute), and I enjoy continuing my undergraduate musicology research on the Jewish Polish Soviet Holocaust-era composer Mieczysław Weinberg.
