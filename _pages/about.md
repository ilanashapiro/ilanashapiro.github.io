Welcome! I am a 2nd-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego in the [Programming Systems](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) group in La Jolla, CA, advised by [Sorin Lerner](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/). I also work closely with [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) and [Shlomo Dubnov](http://shlomodubnov.wikidot.com/about) and am involved in the [Music Understanding Synthesis and AI Creativity](https://ucsd-musaic.github.io/) group. Before coming to UCSD, I double majored in Computer Science and Music and minored in Mathematics at Pomona College in Claremont, CA, where I was advised by [Yuqing Melanie Wu](https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/yuqing-melanie-wu) and [Ben Wiedermann](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/) in CS, and [Alfred Cramer](https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/alfred-cramer) in Music. I also worked briefly as a software engineer at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), and I occasionally freelance at [Stainless](https://www.stainlessapi.com).

My research interests lie in the intersection of Programming Languages (PL), AI, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I aim to develop human-interpretable structural constraints on sequence models for the controllable generation of well-formed sequence data, with a particular interest in music generation. My ultimate goal is to create a richly interactive, human-machine co-creation process enabling end-users to produce structurally sound media.

My most recent work investigated stochastic and formal logic techniques to frame and solve the dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem of music structure summarization. I am currently exploring how to apply these results as structural constraints on sequence models. Previously, my undergrad research combined mathematical and formal methods with HCI to give end-users tools for music creation. Check out [Projects](projects/) and [Publications](publications/) for more details!

Besides research, I am passionate about mentoring, and am excited to serve as Mentorship Co-Chair for UCSD's [Graduate Women in Computing](https://gradwic.ucsd.edu/) organization this year. In my free time, I am an amateur [flutist](https://www.youtube.com/@ilanashapiroflute), and I enjoy continuing my undergraduate musicology research on the Jewish Polish Soviet Holocaust-era composer Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg.
