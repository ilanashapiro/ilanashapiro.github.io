Welcome! I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UC San Diego in the [Programming Systems Group](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/), advised by [Sorin Lerner](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~lerner/). I also work closely with [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) and [Shlomo Dubnov](http://shlomodubnov.wikidot.com/about) and am involved in the [Music Understanding Synthesis and AI Creativity Group](https://ucsd-musaic.github.io/). Before coming to UCSD, I double majored in Computer Science and Music and minored in Mathematics at Pomona College in Claremont, CA, where I was advised by [Yuqing Melanie Wu](https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/yuqing-melanie-wu) and [Ben Wiedermann](https://www.hmc.edu/about/news/experts/ben-wiedermann/) in CS, and [Alfred Cramer](https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/alfred-cramer) in Music.

I am interested in the intersection of PL, AI, and HCI in the context of structured, controllable generative models for human-machine co-creativity. Specifically, I am studying how 

Besides research, I am passionate about mentoring, and am excited to serve as Mentorship Co-Chair for UCSD's Graduate Women in Computing (GradWIC) organization this year. Outside of work, I am an amateur flutist, and I enjoy continuing my undergraduate musicology research on the Jewish Polish Soviet Holocaust-era composer Mieczyslaw Weinberg.
