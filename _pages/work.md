# Graduate Student Researcher, UCSD Programming Systems Group (2023.09 - present)

I am working to integrate the complementary strengths of PL, HCI, and AI to develop human-interpretable structural constraints on sequence models for the controllable, co-creative generation of globally structured sequence data. My most recent work investigated stochastic and formal logic techniques to frame and solve the dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem of music structure summarization.  -->

## Research Intern, Microsoft Research, RiSE Group (2025.06 - 2025.09)

[Research in Software Engineering (RiSE)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/) group at Microsoft Research, supervised by [Nikolaj Bjorner](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nbjorner/). I am investigating algorithms to improve parallel solving in the SMT solver [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), and am also working on natural language reasoning for program verification at the intersection of reinforcement learning and LLMs.

## Freelance Software Engineer, Stainless (2023.02 - 2024.10)

[Stainless](https://www.stainlessapi.com/) is a startup building the platform for high-quality, easy-to-use APIs. To support Stainless, I make open source contributions to codebases including [Stoplight Prism](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism), node-tree-sitter, Microsoft Pyright, NPM Trends, and json-schema-benchmark. My primary contributions are to Prism in mocking and validating APIs using TypeScript, with significant use of functional TypeScript via the [fp-ts library](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts).

## Software Engineer, Meta (2022.10 - 2022.11)

As a full-time software engineer at Meta, I improved the type safety of Hack and Python backend code during engineering bootcamp. I was impacted by the 13% company layoff as a new hire.

## Software Engineering Intern, Facebook (2021.05 - 2021.09)

I was an iOS fullstack intern on Facebook Public Groups. I independently created a new admin list feature for Facebook Groups iOS. I taught myself Hack and built a server-side API in Hack for the new endpoints I required for the frontend, which I built in Objective C++ (specifically, ComponentKit) and GraphQL. I collaborated with project managers, other engineers working on Groups, and designers, and shipped my project at the end of the summer.

## Software Engineering Intern, Facebook (2020.05 - 2020.09)

I was an iOS frontend intern on Facebook Events. I independently created a new events calendar view for Facebook Events iOS using Objective C++ (ComponentKit) and GraphQL. I taught myself ComponentKit and GraphQL, communicated extensively with the designer, and contributed to the design as well as the engineering process. My project was ready to ship by the end of the summer.

## Facebook University Engineering Intern (2019.06 - 2019.09)

As part of Facebook's University for Engineers (FBU) program (renamed to [Meta University](https://www.metacareers.com/careerprograms/pathways/metauniversity)), my team created [DormShop](https://github.com/mloirraqi/Dorm-a-Shop), an iOS app that connects college students to buy and sell. I also completed 3 weeks of CodePath iOS bootcamp making mock Twitter and Instagram apps.
