This undergraduate course (69 students) covers functional programming in the lambda calculus and the Haskell language (including parsing, type systems, functors, monads, etc). As the only TA, I hold weekly office hours, lead weekly sections, monitor the class Piazza forum, grade weekly assignments, and attend staff meetings. At the end of the quarter, I will give synchronous feedback on final project presentations.
