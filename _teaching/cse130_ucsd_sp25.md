This undergraduate course (126 students) covers functional programming in the lambda calculus and the Haskell language (including parsing, type systems, functors, monads, etc). I held weekly office hours, led four discussion sections, monitored the class Piazza forum, and attended staff meetings. At the end of the quarter, I gave synchronous feedback on final project presentations.
