This undergraduate course (20 students) covers database design (entity-relationship model, etc), query languages (relational algebra, relational calculus, SQL), and database management systems (storage model, indexing, query evaluation and optimization, concurrency control). As sole TA, I held twice-weekly mentor hours, and monitored the class Piazza forum.
