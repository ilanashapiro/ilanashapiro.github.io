title: "Virtual Ensemble Assembly: Musicality in Separation"
duration: "2020.08 - 2020.12"
excerpt: "In an independent study during my undergrad, I assisted Dr. Christopher Raphael at Indiana University Bloomington on a project investigating audio algorithms for music score alignment. We developed a novel algorithm to synchronously assemble remotely recorded audio tracks without click tracks in order to address the need for remote media collaboration induced by the ongoing COVID pandemic."
