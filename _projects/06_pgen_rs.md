title: "pgen-rs: LLM-Aided Genomic Data Wrangling"
duration: "2024.03-2024.05"
excerpt: "In order to perform genomic data analyses, bioinformaticians are frequently forced to do cubmersome pre-processing of their data. To addres these challenges, in a class project, we developed pgen-rs, a tool enabling end-users to write their data wrangling requirements in natural language enhanced by LLM suggestions. pgen-rs converts natural language to a DSL that is executed by out Rust-based high-performance genomic data processor enabled by the PLINK file format."
