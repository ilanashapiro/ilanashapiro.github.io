title: "DNA to Music (MIDI) Translation"
duration: "2019.01 - 2019.05"
excerpt: "In a class research project during my first year of undergrad, I created an original Python-based model to sonify genetic material by translating DNA to MIDI piano chords. By mapping nucleotides and codons to musical chords, my work introduced a novel and straightforward means of conceptualizing both the structure of a gene and the processes of biological splicing and translation that is accessible to users of all scientific backgrounds."
