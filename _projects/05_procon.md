title: "Continuous Enumeration for Just-In-Time Bottom-Up Synthesis"
duration: "2024.01-2024.03"
excerpt: "In a class project, we developed ProCon, a tool implementing continuous, rule-based enumeration for just-in-time bottom-up search in SyGuS problems. Programs are enumerated in order of continuous, nonrounded weights as determined by a probabilistic weighting function. ProCon thus leverages the full power of the probabilistic model since it does not round the probabilities to discrete weights as size-based enumeration does."
