title: "Deriving Representative Structure Over Music Corpora"
duration: "2024.03-2025.01"
excerpt: "I introduced a unified, hierarchical meta-representation of sequence data structure called the structural temporal graph (STG), a k-partite directed acyclic graph, and applied it to symbolic music. Then, I used simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Finally, I combined the formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over structural distances to frame and solve the dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem of music structure summarization as an extension of the Generalized Median Graph problem."
