title: "MusAssist: Domain Specific Language for Music"
duration: "2022.01-2022.05"
excerpt: "Under the mentorship of Dr. Ben Wiedermann at Harvey Mudd College, I created MusAssist, a DSL for music notation bridging the abstraction gap between music theory and composition. MusAssist gives end-users the novel ability to describe musical templates, such as cadences, at precisely the abstraction level as the music theoretic structures they represent, which models what a composer would organically conceive when composing by hand. I designed MusAssistâ€™s syntax using a participatory design approach, and then wrote a Haskell-based compiler that translates MusAssist to MusicXML, a lower-level language accepted by most music notation software, for further manual editing."
